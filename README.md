Sundial. Ancient times, people aren't progressed enough to make clocks yet, imprecise measurements of the sun's movement giving the time on the sundial. Right?

WRONGGGG!!!!
Sundials aren't just clocks, they tell us a lot about how the heavenly objects work, how the ecliptic moves with the seasons. And not just for us Earthers. It's a sundial after all, not an Earthdial!

In this project I have digitally rendered a real time version of sundial using precise mathematical modelling and astronomical data. I have initially worked on Sundials for every other planet in the solar system, but soon hope to generalize it for any other planet in the universe. The biggest challenge for that is the dearth of exoplanetary data to work with.
